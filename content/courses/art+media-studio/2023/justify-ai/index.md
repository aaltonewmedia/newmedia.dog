## Our mission

The #1 tool for mitigating the effects of cognitive dissonance in the workplace 

The common perception is that humans use reasoning to solve complex issues. Scientists have discovered, however, that most decisions are made subconsciously, and reasoning enters the picture only after the fact when we need to justify our actions.  

When there is a disparity between an action we have committed and the mental models we have available to make sense of them, cognitive dissonance occurs. Cognitive dissonance registers in the anterior cingulate cortex, where the brain also processes sensations of pain. This is what makes it a stressful condition that, when prolonged, can lead to severe anxiety, mental fatigue, and decreased productivity. To reduce these effects in today’s hectic work environment, we present a solution: Justify.ai. 

By utilizing multidisciplinary research from the fields of human-computer interaction, cognitive psychology and machine learning, we at Justify.ai have developed a tool that is trained to mirror the cognitive behaviours our brains deploy when processing cognitive dissonance.  

When you pose a dilemma to Justify.ai, it is trained to present you these options that are scientifically proven to be the most effective: 

>Change the behavior or the cognition ("I'll stop offering these non-organically produced coffee beans in my cafeteria.") 
>
>Justify the behavior or the cognition, by changing the conflicting cognition ("It is impossible to monitor the entire supply chain of all of my products, so >offering these coffee beans is a reasonable compromise.") 
>
>Justify the behavior or the cognition by adding new behaviors or cognitions ("I'll spend less on coffee beans but will use what I save up for sourcing >organically produced oats for the porridge that we offer.") 
>
>Reorient your relationship with the information that conflicts with existing beliefs ("Can I truly trust the supplier of the organic alternative? Are >organic products important to the values of my cafeteria?” )

We at Justify.ai believe that you should be the driving force behind your actions. We want you to feel like you have left no stone unturned while resolving whatever issue you are facing and are presented with multiple options in a clear and concise manner.
