## Description

Creatures of the fog is a project produced for the visual enjoyment and look into various movements and forms. I wanted a viewer to immerse into the magical world of peculiar creatures, observe them, and think about what they meant. Initially it was planned as a black and white vj installation, but as soon as I entered the exploration it has evolved into a simpler but more atmospheric piece.
