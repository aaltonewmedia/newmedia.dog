## Description

The xxxerophyte visuals are an abstract representation of the xxxerophyte audio (created by Sarah Khadra Hasni). The generative shapes respond in size and geometry to the sound, and never repeat the same form. They are composed of several basic geometries (circles, squares and triangles) that are placed on a grid and are ‘activated' based on noise (visual) and noise (auditory). The image is texturised by embossed ASCII characters that move with the video. I followed two tutorials for the two separate components.
