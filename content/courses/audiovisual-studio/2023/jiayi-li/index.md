## Description

This is an experimental audiovisual work that Jiayi integrate AI-generated content into a real-time visual generative piece. This real-time interaction contains a face that melts and recovers with the music constantly at the center of the screen, and live camera images at four corners of the screen. The viewers can make different actions to the camera and have it generate an AI picture as a new face based on the current camera image as Control Net. In addition, the parts of the face (eyes, nose, ears, mouth, eyebrows) make different expressions based on the music to make the image more vivid.
