## Description

This project was inspired by my personal life experiences, especially my inner feelings when falling asleep at night. In my daily life, I often have difficulty falling asleep and my brain is filled with thoughts and emotions as I lie in bed at night. When I am extremely tired, I often feel my bed spinning and vibrating, a state that is characterized by a profound sadness. The goal of Nightmare Reverie is to express, through video art, the emotions and experiences I have when I have trouble falling asleep at night. By transforming my room into point clouds and giving it a visual effect of spinning and vibrating, guided by music, I try to convey the inner turmoil and emotional turmoil.
