## Description

In this project, I designed a 3D model of a wave in the center, the shape of which changes in sync with the rhythm of the music. I chose to represent emotions using the feature of a water wave because emotions, whether positive or negative, often ebb and flow like the tides in the ocean. Therefore, this form of representation can be an effective way to express the emotions conveyed by music. In future rendering, I may adjust the height of the rendering to provide a simple indicator of the emotion expression according to the music. For example, cheerful music may be represented by a generally higher tide in the rendering compared to sad music.
