## Description

In this video, I attempt to explore how text morphs in response to music. Moving text, or in other words kinesthetic typography, captivates me, as it highlights the intriguing duality of letters. On one hand, individual letters possess distinct and familiar functions (for example, convey information), while on the other, they form a typeface with an intricate network of relationships between meticulously designed characters. Forming text into patterns, making it move and morph fascinates me because for a brief moment type’s appearance and visual form supersedes its function.
