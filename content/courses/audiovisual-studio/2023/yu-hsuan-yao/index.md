## By Yu-Hsuan Yao

## Description

The real-time project extends the boundaries of minimalistic aesthetics through the use
of elementary geometric shapes and monochromatic palette. In contrast to the captivating visual extravagance often found in new media art, Maljat revisits the foundational principles of audiovisual art, embarking on a journey of exploration through simplicity.
